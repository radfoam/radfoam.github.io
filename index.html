      <p>
        Research on differentiable scene representations is consistently moving towards more efficient, real-time
        models.
        Recently, this has led to the popularization of splatting methods, which eschew the traditional ray-based
        rendering of radiance fields in favor of rasterization.
        This has yielded a significant improvement in rendering speeds due to the efficiency of rasterization algorithms
        and hardware, but has come at a cost: the approximations that make rasterization efficient also make
        implementation of light transport phenomena like reflection and refraction much more difficult.
        We propose a novel scene representation which avoids these approximations, but keeps the efficiency and
        reconstruction quality of splatting by leveraging a decades-old efficient volumetric mesh ray tracing algorithm
        which has been largely overlooked in recent computer vision research.
        The resulting model, which we name <em>Radiant Foam</em>, achieves rendering speed and quality comparable to
        Gaussian Splatting, without the constraints of rasterization.
        Unlike ray traced Gaussian models that use <em>hardware</em> ray tracing acceleration, our method requires no
        special hardware or APIs beyond the standard features of a programmable GPU.

      <p>
        Our representation is based on the Voronoi diagram (right), which divides space into cells based on proximity
        to a set
        of points called <em>sites</em>.
        The Voronoi diagram is dual to the Delaunay triangulation (center), and by constructing a Delaunay triangulation
        from a
        learnable point set, we are able to maintain an adjacency structure that indicates which Voronoi cells are
        neighbours.
      </p>

        <img src="./img/dual_3.png" class="subfigure">
      </div>
      <p>
        Using this adjacency structure, we can easily compute ray-cell intersections by iterating over the neighbours of
        each cell and finding the nearest front-facing plane intersection.
        By performing this process iteratively, we can efficiently trace rays through the foam, stepping from cell to
        cell.
        This algorithm is much more efficient than typical ray tracing acceleration methods that rely on hierarchical
        acceleration structures with logarithmic query complexity.
      </p>
      <div class="figure">
        <img src="./img/ray_tracing.png" class="subfigure">
      </div>
      <p>
        Our method also avoids the challenges typically associated with optimizing a discrete mesh, as the cell
        boundaries of the Voronoi diagram vary continuously with changes in the positions of sites.
        This is due to the property of Voronoi diagrams that discrete changes in connectivity are effectively
        <em>hidden</em> in zero-surface area faces, while other options like using the Delaunay mesh directly would lead
        to large discontinuities in the field whenever connectivity changes.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>
        The result is a flexible, differentiable model that can be ray traced in real time at speeds significantly
        outperforming hardware-accelerated Gaussian ray tracing, while nearly matching the reconstruction quality of
        Gaussian splatting methods.
