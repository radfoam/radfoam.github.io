      <strong>Abstract:</strong>
      <p>
        Radiance fields have revolutionized the field of 3D understanding from images. Early in their history, NeRF
        methods produced high quality models, but struggled to match the speeds required by computer graphics
        applications. Recently, the field has embraced the use of models based on splatting, which take advantage of the
        superior efficiency of rasterization, and achieve real-time speeds in inference. This arc of development mirrors
        the history of real-time computer graphics itself. A broad space of rendering methods and representations of
        geometry gave way to the uniform adoption of triangles and hardware rasterization, as these delivered the speeds
        needed for interactive applications. However, as algorithms and hardware have evolved, various rendering
        techniques based on ray tracing have once again become popular, as ray tracing allows for the natural expression
        of many light transport phenomena which are difficult or impossible to produce with rasterization. In this
        project, we aim to create similar opportunities for radiance fields by proposing a radiance field representation
        which admits a ray tracing algorithm efficient enough to challenge rasterization.

        Our method works by filling space with a polyhedral open-cell foam constructed from a learnable, adaptively
        densified point set through the Voronoi diagram. By endowing each cell with the density and radiance properties
        of a radiance field, we define a model which can be volumetrically rendered in a differentiable manner. The
        process of rendering can then be accelerated by walking through the foam from cell to cell, crossing polyhedral
        faces which intersect the ray. We show that this yields fast rendering (between 150-180 FPS on the Mip-NeRF 360
        dataset), while supporting the full range of features one would expect from a ray tracer, such as non-pinhole
        cameras and secondary reflection rays. We also completely avoid the dependence of competing real-time ray
        tracing methods on dedicated ray tracing hardware, as our method can be implemented efficiently on any GPU with
        modern programmable shading capabilities.
